## Keynote - Better Work Through Better Feedback
Keavy McMinn @keavy

### Asking for feedback
- What exactly do you want feedback on? Be explicit.
- When do you want feedback? Is your PR WIP (are you on the right direction?) or ready for review?
- Who do you want feedback from? Whose knowledge, expertise and point of view would you like?

### Giving feedback

When commenting on PRs, and giving feedback in general:

- Wait a few minutes, especially if you disagree
- Ask, don't tell (critique, not criticize)
- Be humble
- Explain reasons for changes to give context
- Use positive language over neutral, as it can be seen as negative
- Use emojis!!!
- Disapproval Matrix - Ann Friedman
